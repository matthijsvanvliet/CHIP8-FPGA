2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PLIO-8#1 Warning
Placement Constraints Check for IO constraints  
Terminal o_keypad_row1 has IOB constraint set to TRUE, but it is either not connected to a FLOP element or the connected FLOP element could not be brought into the I/O.
Related violations: <none>

PLIO-8#2 Warning
Placement Constraints Check for IO constraints  
Terminal o_keypad_row2 has IOB constraint set to TRUE, but it is either not connected to a FLOP element or the connected FLOP element could not be brought into the I/O.
Related violations: <none>

PLIO-8#3 Warning
Placement Constraints Check for IO constraints  
Terminal o_keypad_row3 has IOB constraint set to TRUE, but it is either not connected to a FLOP element or the connected FLOP element could not be brought into the I/O.
Related violations: <none>

PLIO-8#4 Warning
Placement Constraints Check for IO constraints  
Terminal o_keypad_row4 has IOB constraint set to TRUE, but it is either not connected to a FLOP element or the connected FLOP element could not be brought into the I/O.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1617#1 Warning
use_IOB_register  
The FDRE cell k/column_pins_reg[0] has IOB set to TRUE, but does not connect directly to an IO cell. Remove the constraint or ensure the FDRE is properly connected to an IO.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1617#2 Warning
use_IOB_register  
The FDRE cell k/column_pins_reg[1] has IOB set to TRUE, but does not connect directly to an IO cell. Remove the constraint or ensure the FDRE is properly connected to an IO.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1617#3 Warning
use_IOB_register  
The FDRE cell k/column_pins_reg[2] has IOB set to TRUE, but does not connect directly to an IO cell. Remove the constraint or ensure the FDRE is properly connected to an IO.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1617#4 Warning
use_IOB_register  
The FDRE cell k/column_pins_reg[3] has IOB set to TRUE, but does not connect directly to an IO cell. Remove the constraint or ensure the FDRE is properly connected to an IO.
Related violations: <none>
